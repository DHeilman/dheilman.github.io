<p>Over the last decade, I've been many things: pharmacy and art history student, cancer survivor, caretaker, CEO and cofounder of my own 501(c), and an array of job titles with a concentration in customer service. Throughout my tumultuous and formative early 20's, one thing has always rung true: I love to learn and make beautiful things. It is my need to satiate my love of learning, art, and problem solving that has led me to the front door of product and web design.
